Overview of our directory structure:

- `data/`: project datasets containing raw, training and test data, as well as visualizations
- `docs/`: documents pertaining to the project (e.g., reference papers, supporting docs)
- `eval/`: model performance metrics, plots, tables and other output used to evaluate models
- `logs/`: logs for all experiments and scripts
- `models/`: trained models for future predictions and files created by models, including intermediate steps or for testing purposes (e.g., selection among different model experiments)
- `personal/`: project files and folders that are being tested and are specific to each user before being put in a shared folder
- `src/`: project source code (pushed to the repository)

Each part of the code has a corresponding README.md in its own directory. They
can be viewed by simply navigating to the directory on Github's file browser
(or you can just open them locally :P).
